1. When we click on one (navbar-toggler collapsed) the other also opens.
Its the button which appears when we minimize the windows
2. When we remove the link for ioncons and download and use the file. It doesnt
show the image of cart
3. Appropriate views should be displayed when clicking on a specific category
e.g. If a category is clicked while on clothes page then clothes according to that
category should be displayed.
4. Search is not working
5. When I write name in category, slug it is auto filled. Not in other Models, why
6. Make a mechanism that we use only the products.detail.html and
products.list.html view for all products.
