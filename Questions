1. How are the urls working in the base.urls file

url(r'^events/', include('events.urls', namespace='events')),

How does it know where is events package or directory, because the events
are under the apps directory.

2. url(r'^(?P<event_uuid>\w+)/advanced-settings/event-details/$',
   EventDetailsView.as_view(),
   name='event_details'),

What does this r'^(?P<event_uuid>\w+) mean/do. (r, ^, ?, P, \w+)

3. BASE_PROJECT_APPS in the base.py class. How does it get the app package
directly because these apps are under apps folder, not directly under site

4. How do the static files and static_root work. Is this static_root folder and
files auto generated? How are we deploying them on the server.

5. Is it wise to keep the secret key in the base file?

6. Even after setting the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE in wsgi file it doesn't work
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'settings.settings')

Does it not read wsgi.py file on starting the project

7. url(regex, view, kwargs=None, name=None) This function is an alias to django.urls.re_path(). Itâ€™s likely to be deprecated in a future release. Why we are using url()

8. How are static / media roots used and where and how are they deployed in the production

9. How the get_absolute_url() is working

10. How is on_delete working in the models. e.g. If I delete the CLothes object what will on_delete do if its value was CASCADE

11. How does slug work
