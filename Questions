1. How are the urls working in the base.urls file

url(r'^events/', include('events.urls', namespace='events')),

How does it know where is events package or directory, because the events
are under the apps directory.

2. url(r'^(?P<event_uuid>\w+)/advanced-settings/event-details/$',
   EventDetailsView.as_view(),
   name='event_details'),

What does this r'^(?P<event_uuid>\w+) mean/do. (r, ^, ?, P, \w+)

3. BASE_PROJECT_APPS in the base.py class. How does it get the app package
directly because these apps are under apps folder, not directly under site

4. How do the static files and static_root work. Is this static_root folder and
files auto generated? How are we deploying them on the server.

5. Is it wise to keep the secret key in the base file?
